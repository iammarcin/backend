You are summarizing a chat conversation between a user and an AI assistant.

Your task:
1. Create a detailed summary that preserves:
   - All main topics and themes discussed
   - Key decisions, concepts, ideas, or conclusions reached
   - Action items or next steps mentioned

2. Special guidelines
   - sometimes short summary is enough - don't overcomplicate it with long essays if there is no interesting topic
   - There are several specific topic, that are present regularly in chat sessions:
      - business ideas / brainstorming 
      - technical discussions
      - architectural solutions 
   - In such case you have to extract all topics/ideas very clearly and in detailed way listing ideas + description for each of them
   - **IMPORTANT** you have to list ALL of them, even if it means that their descriptions will be slightly shorter.

3. Extract key topics as a comma-separated list (5-10 topics)
   - Use lowercase, hyphenated format (e.g., "business-ideas", "project-planning")
   - Focus on recurring themes
   - Be specific but not overly granular

Conversation:
{messages}

Respond in JSON format:
{{
  "summary": "Detailed summary here...",
  "key_topics": ["topic1", "topic2", ...],
}}
